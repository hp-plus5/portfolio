    The image gets cropped (on LinkedIn) into a 1.91:1 ratio and 1200 (width) x 627 (height) pixels. So you need an image with a compatible ratio and width of 1200px+. If needed, one could add more than one image meta tag. The first listed is given preference during conflicts. Follow up each meta image tag with its immediate properties, such as "og:image:height" or "og:image:alt" before moving to the next "og:image" meta tag.

  <meta property="og:description" content="Sam Warner is an intrinsically motivated self-starter who has produced high quality content both in an entirely independent contributor format and on a team. As someone who values emotional intelligence and empathy in the workplace, he has contributed to widening the knowledge base and improving communication between teams and vertical hierarchies in previous positions.

  Sam's six years of work experience have taken place in a number of different web development ecosystems. Those years have only touched the surface of all of the expertise he's ravenous for, but they have taught him to more deeply apply strategic concepts to any given project. In his past jobs, he's proven his ability to use a creative, analytical mindset to leave the company functioning more efficiently than he originally found it. He'd love to learn more about what your needs are and how he can help contribute to the success of your company." />

            <p>"Sam has to be one of the most kind and intelligent individuals I’ve had the fortune of working with. As far as personality, he’s the person in school who is the first to talk to the new kid, and invite them to his lunch table. He is the person to speak out when himself or his friends are wronged. Sam’s friendliness, patience, and openness are contagious, and those around him are made better as a result.</p>

            <p>As it relates to developing and professionalism, Sam is someone who will explain (and re-explain) concepts or his thoughts in different ways until it is understood. His depth of knowledge, even when first starting out, is impressive and comforting. From a tester’s perspective, Sam was always very easy to work with. His notes are made in a way to benefit everyone, not just himself. His code is clean and easy to understand. When he is unsure of something, he ensures he not only finds a resolution for himself, but those around him that may benefit from further clarity are also brought in.</p>

            <p>In summary, the world needs more people like Sam. I would urge anybody looking his way to consider taking the one that is in front of them, you won’t regret it."</p>

As someone that didn't have prior experience working in an engineering environment, I'm very thankful to have had Sam to learn from! Though not my direct leader, Sam always went out of their way to help me understand the different aspects of software development used at Within3 and as a result of that training, I was able to become much more comfortable in my role! Sam offered weekly sessions where I could ask questions about anything that I was working on personally or learn through him teaching using items he was working on. If you’re looking for an all-around great person, collaborator and leader on your team, I know that Sam will be an amazing addition to your organization!"</p>
