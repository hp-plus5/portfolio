# Portfolio

This repository is the portfolio repository of Sam Danger Warner. I wrote it myself from scratch. If you want to run this locally, there's no need to build - if you use an IDE software called VS Code, you just need to look at your bottom bar and select "Go Live". It will give you a port you can go to for local development. (It will look like this: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` with the `/index.html` being optional. If your port at :5500 is taken, VS Code will alert you to a new port.) If you don't have VS Code, just open the file "index.html" in your browser and it should still pull in the other files as needed. I built this minimally because the needs of the project are minimal.

Things I'd like to deal with:
- on mobile, i want project images to be as easy to blow up as they are on desktop. how can i mimic that behavior? probably a codepen somewhere already with that functioning.
- the cute little cheeks on github's ascii art resolve to those rectangles. but those little rectangles are still really cute and they actually kinda match the aesthetic *more*... do i keep them?
